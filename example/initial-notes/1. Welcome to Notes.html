  This is a small Notes app built on <a href="https://github.com/bengotow/electron-rxdb">Electron-RxDB</a>.
  A few notes have been added already - you can update a note by typing here,
  or create a new note in the bottom right. As you make changes, notes are saved
  back to SQLite and the interface updates automatically. This is possible because
  React components in the UI are bound to RxDB observable queries.
</p>
<p>
  Check out <strong><code>sidebar-recents.jsx</code></strong> for an example of an observable query.

  In this demo, you can also search notes using SQLite full-text search (FTS5). It's hard to
  demonstrate on a small data set, but SQLite FTS5 remains performant on hundreds
  of thousands of rows. <strong>To make things more fun, click the "Wikipedia" button below.</strong>
  The demo will crawl Wikipedia and pull down articles until you click the button again.

  Want to check out the SQLite data manually? This sample app writes to
  <strong><code>~/Library/Application Support/Notes/sqlite.db</code></strong> on Mac OS X.
