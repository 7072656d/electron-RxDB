Named for its <a href="/wiki/64-bit_computing" title="64-bit computing">64-bit</a> <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit" title="Central processing unit">central processing unit</a>, it was released in June 1996 in <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, September 1996 in <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, March 1997 in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, September 1997 in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> and December 1997 in <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. It is the industry's last major home console to use the <a href="/wiki/ROM_cartridge" title="ROM cartridge">cartridge</a> as its primary storage format, although current handheld systems (such as the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_Vita" title="PlayStation Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_3DS" title="Nintendo 3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>) also use cartridges. While the Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's <a href="/wiki/MiniDVD" title="MiniDVD">MiniDVD</a>-based <a href="/wiki/GameCube" title="GameCube">GameCube</a> in November 2001, the consoles remained available until the system was retired in late 2003.</p>
<p>Code named <b>Project Reality</b>, the console's design was mostly finalized by mid-1995, though Nintendo 64's launch was delayed until 1996.<sup id="cite_ref-Fisher_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fisher-6">[6]</a></sup> As part of the <a href="/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(fifth_generation)" class="mw-redirect" title="History of video game consoles (fifth generation)">fifth generation of gaming</a>, the system competed primarily with the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_(console)" title="PlayStation (console)">PlayStation</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sega_Saturn" title="Sega Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>. The Nintendo 64 was <a href="/wiki/Launch_game" class="mw-redirect" title="Launch game">launched with three games</a>: <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Mario_64" title="Super Mario 64">Super Mario 64</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Pilotwings_64" title="Pilotwings 64">Pilotwings 64</a></i>, released worldwide; and <i><a href="/wiki/Saiky%C5%8D_Habu_Sh%C5%8Dgi" title="Saikyō Habu Shōgi">Saikyō Habu Shōgi</a></i>, released only in Japan. The Nintendo 64's <a href="/wiki/Suggested_retail_price" class="mw-redirect" title="Suggested retail price">suggested retail price</a> at its United States launch was <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$199.99</span> and it was later marketed with the slogan "Get N, or get Out!". With 32.93 million units worldwide, the console was ultimately released in a range of different colors and designs, and an assortment of limited-edition controllers were sold or used as contest prizes during the system's lifespan. <a href="/wiki/IGN" title="IGN">IGN</a> named it the 9th greatest video game console of all time;<sup id="cite_ref-IGN_ranking_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IGN_ranking-7">[7]</a></sup> and in 1996, <i><a href="/wiki/Time_Magazine" class="mw-redirect" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a></i> named it Machine of the Year.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, Nintendo led the video game industry with its <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="Nintendo Entertainment System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES). Although the NES follow-up console, the <a href="/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="Super Nintendo Entertainment System">Super NES</a> (SNES), was successful, sales took a hit from the <a href="/wiki/Lost_Decade_(Japan)" title="Lost Decade (Japan)">Japanese recession</a>. Competition from long-time rival Sega, and relative newcomer Sony, emphasized Nintendo's need to develop a successor for the SNES, or risk losing market dominance to its rivals. Further complicating matters, Nintendo also faced a backlash from third-party developers unhappy with Nintendo's strict licensing policies.<sup id="cite_ref-Brandt_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brandt-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Silicon_Graphics" title="Silicon Graphics">Silicon Graphics, Inc.</a> (SGI), a long-time leader in graphics visualization and supercomputing, was interested in expanding its business by adapting its technology into the higher volume realm of consumer products, starting with the video game market. Based upon its <a href="/wiki/MIPS_R4000" class="mw-redirect" title="MIPS R4000">MIPS R4000</a> family of supercomputing and workstation CPUs, SGI developed a CPU requiring a fraction of the resources—consuming only 0.5 watts of power instead of 1.5 to 2 watts, with an estimated target price of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$40</span> instead of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$80</span>–200.<sup id="cite_ref-Video_Game_Link_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Video_Game_Link-10">[10]</a></sup> The company created a design proposal for a video game system, seeking an already well established partner in that market. <a href="/wiki/James_H._Clark" title="James H. Clark">James H. Clark</a>, founder of SGI, initially offered the proposal to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Kalinske" title="Tom Kalinske">Tom Kalinske</a>, who was the <a href="/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief executive officer">CEO</a> of <a href="/wiki/Sega" title="Sega">Sega</a> of America. The next candidate was Nintendo.</p>
<p>The historical details of these preliminary negotiations were controversial between the two competing suitors.<sup id="cite_ref-Brandt_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brandt-9">[9]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Tom_Kalinske" title="Tom Kalinske">Tom Kalinske</a> said that he and Joe Miller of Sega of America were "quite impressed" with SGI's prototype, inviting their hardware team to travel from Japan to meet with SGI. The engineers from Sega Enterprises claimed that their evaluation of the early prototype had uncovered several unresolved hardware issues and deficiencies. Those were subsequently resolved, but Sega had already decided against SGI's design.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Nintendo resisted that summary conclusion, arguing that the reason for SGI's ultimate choice of partner is due to Nintendo having been a more appealing business partner than Sega.<sup id="cite_ref-Brandt_9-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brandt-9">[9]</a></sup> While Sega demanded exclusive rights to the chip, Nintendo was willing to license the technology on a non-exclusive basis.<sup id="cite_ref-Brandt_9-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brandt-9">[9]</a></sup> Michael Slater, publisher of <i><a href="/wiki/Microprocessor_Report" title="Microprocessor Report">Microprocessor Report</a></i> said, "The mere fact of a business relationship there is significant because of Nintendo's phenomenal ability to drive volume. If it works at all, it could bring MIPS to levels of volume [SGI] never dreamed of".<sup id="cite_ref-Video_Game_Link_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Video_Game_Link-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
